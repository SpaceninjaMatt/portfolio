description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the need for student access to prints beyond conventional hours, I initiated an engineering project inspired by the functionality of Amazon Lockers. The goal was to develop a scaled-down automated pickup system enabling 24/7 access to prints, thereby streamlining the process.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began with a proof-of-concept single-cell prototype and, upon receiving approval from my supervisor, advanced to the next phase of the project.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a span of several weeks, I designed a 16-cell version of the system using Solidworks. The final design comprised five 100x200 mm cells, nine 200x200 mm cells (as featured in the prototype), and two 100x300 mm cells made specifically to accommodate filament and lengthy prints."
outcome: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project's successful completion resulted in significant learning outcomes and technical achievements. Notably, the integration of compliant 3D-printed components for the latches enhanced the system's functionality and durability.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project also involved managing a complex SolidWorks assembly consisting of approximately 230 components. This process provided a substantial learning experience, expanding my expertise and confidence in handling intricate engineering designs.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A critical aspect of the project was utilizing the integrated EEPROM memory of the Arduino board, enabling the system to retain cell object states during battery swaps. The use of the Arduino R4 facilitated the development of a Bluetooth Low Energy Python application for remote system interfacing. Additionally, the R4's built-in RTC, in conjunction with an SD card module, allowed for tracking locker states over time, optimizing lab staffing strategies.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project addressed a tangible real-world problem, resulting in the creation of a robust and user-friendly automated pickup system that will benefit the student community long after my graduation.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project demonstrates my proficiency in conceiving, designing, and implementing innovative solutions, reinforcing my commitment to engineering and problem-solving."
